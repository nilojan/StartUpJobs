StartupJobs.asia was very helpful in our search for expanding the development team. Getting technical talents in Singapore can be difficult; and kudos to the team at StartupJobs for integrating themselves well into the tech community in Singapore. We successfully found a new addition to our team within just a week of posting the job ad. Thanks once again; and SUJ comes strongly recommended!</div>

The StartUpJobs.asia platform is truly fit for purpose, and easy to adapt to. Right from the signup process, to the ease of posting a job, and receiving applicants is quite straightforward for an employer. I have received several credible applications, which is what I would expect from a job site. The look is modern, and the layout is easy to navigate. The fact that you allow startups such as mine to post for free, is much appreciated. Keep up the good work!</div>

Startupjobs.asia is the first place we come to everytime we need to recruit. Startup life is very different from that in corporate, and the applicant’s coming to Startupjobs.asia know what they’re getting into. Mindset makes a huge difference.

Startupjobs.asia was incredibly helpful on our search for an operations manager. The onboarding was really straight-forward, the interface was easy to use, and we had our job ad posted within ten minutes. The fact that we got 1800 views overnight was also nice! That being said, the quality of applicants was great. Indeed, we ended up hiring the first person that we interviewed. We strongly recommend StartupJobs.asia for startups looking to hire in SG and abroad.</div>

Startupjob.asia offers a very easy and appealing interface to post job offers. Being a start-up specific jobs portal, the potential candidates are all looking to work in a startup and in a way, filtered out candidates looking for jobs in MNC or SME. The result is you get good candidates willingly to follow their passion and takes some risks in exchange for more learning opportunities.We have since hire our Software Manager from Startup Jobs Asia</div>

Hiring for a start up is not easy, when you go to traditional sites to post jobs, start up founders sometimes have to convince them to join a start up. Candidates coming from startupjobs are all prepared to join a startup and raring to go.<br />

I posted for an intern and got a part time editor with his own connections of writers, how’s that for a great platform?<br />

Definitely a great service, site and the first place I go to whenever I need to hire talent.<br />

Hey StartupJobs,<br /><br />

Wanna write a thank you note for helping us with the recent hire. Would love to engage you guys again. Esp if you offer hiring in Jakarta as well.<br />

“Hiring in a start up is very challenging. While a start up would need someone with highly specialized skill, the new person has to be flexible and adaptable to fit in other roles that may not have been captured in the job description. What we found out was other job portals offer candidates that were suitable for traditional firms but not so much of a dynamic tech start up. StartUp Jobs however has been consistent in offering candidates who had talent and knew what kind of challenges they are getting themselves into when applying for the job application.<br /><br />

Thanks Startup Jobs.”<br />

Startup Jobs Asia has been the best performing jobs portal for us compared to the other job portals we have tried. We advertised for a Singapore / PR mobile app programmer. Through Startup Jobs Asia we managed to get at least 2 – 3 local applicants which is much better than the others. The other job portals that we tried have yielded purely foreigner applications, thus not achieving our search criteria.

Startup Jobs has given us 2 precious team members. Our first developer and designer hire came from SUJ. We had a great response both times when we put up the call for resumes. The process on SUJ is simple enough and the lack of clutter and “options” makes it easy to reach out to talent. Thank you Startup Jobs Asia.

I would just like to let you know that you are doing a fantastic job at StartupJobs.Asia. During our recent recruitment round, we posted ads on a number of platforms, including Monster, LinkedIn and other “big name” sites – but the best quality candidates came from StartupJobs.Asia.<br /><br />

The profile of candidate that your website attracts is not merely limited to the stereotypical tech geek with wacky ideas but no practical experience. We received applications from investment bankers, management consultants, accountants and former/failed entrepreneurs eager for a chance to get back in the game. In fact, we were contacted by so many high-quality applicants that we had some very tough decisions to make. The final three candidates that we shortlisted all came from your site. Perhaps we shouldn’t even bother with any other sites in the future!<br /><br />

I know that this website is a labour of love, borne out of a genuine desire to breathe fresh life into the entrepreneurial ecosystem here in Asia. You guys are doing great work. There will come a day when the very best talents in the region aspire to become entrepreneurs instead of work for blue-chip MNCs. When that day comes, the world will be a better place. Society as a whole will benefit from more creative solutions to problems, more jobs created, a more passionate and engaged workforce, and greater social mobility. And all of this will be thanks to people like you.<br />

First and foremost, we deeply appreciate it that Startup Jobs Asia has opened up its platform to allow us to post our job ad for free.

Being a Taipei-based start-up with expanding business in China, the next logical step for us was to find a local employee in Shanghai; the right person with matching expectations and motivation. It was through a friend’s recommendation that I heard about startupjobs.asia and it is through this portal that we found the most suitable candidates.<br /><br />

As the candidates had found us through this start-up specific portal, their expectations were mostly suitable to the employment we offer; those were persons looking for a young and flexible environment such as ours, aware and accepting of potential down-sides of working with a start-up.<br /><br />

We ended up employing through startupjobs.asia and have been enjoying a fruitful and very positive collaboration with our employee.

The results for my company, Street Smart Mobile, is tremendous. Within a month of placing our positions for apprentices, we have 2 highly motivated and talented individuals dedicating their time and resources for the cause and we are merely weeks away from launching our awesome App, Street Smart University, to place world class learning in the palms of the rising Asian middle class.

It is an undeniable winning case – startups flock to SUJ because it is THE place to find talent, and talented individuals wanting to dedicate themselves to world changing ideas find the positions there. While still at humble beginnings, we are proud to be a partner of SUJ and know that so many other companies can greatly benefit, perhaps even more, than how we have.

If you have the opportunity to work with SUJ, place a position, find a job, partner with them, don’t hesitate. You’re talking about Asia’s premier Start jobs portal!<br />

<div>Since we began posting openings on StartUpJobs.Asia in February, we’ve been really impressed with the volume of qualified candidates we’ve been seeing. Techis such a unique community it really merits its own dedicated recruiting site; that’s especially true in a tight labour market like we have here in Singapore. Our recruiting thus far has been for our “GEMS Pro Retail” mobile employee productivity software. With plans to launch our own early stage funding vehicle soon, our use of StartUpJobs.Asia will most certainly expand, and I expect it to be a vital component of our recruiting efforts.<br />

Great site, we’re a game studio that are currently writing a proposal to pitch our game project to get initial funding to start programming side work on our upcoming game. We’ve done physical play testing and found the game very marketable. We hope to find suitable talent for our company via this site in future.

P.S: I hope this site becomes a great hit. It’s hard for Singaporeans like us to put ourselves on the global map for anything. ~ Tactical Revolutions Game Studios<br />

A very professional company to work with, we received more than 5 CVs in few days, arranged interviews and hired the guy to work as a social media marketer.

I strongly suggest to support Startup Jobs Asia for your startup needs!<br />

<div class="Testi"><b>Successful Match-up of Technical Co-Founder</b>
<img alt="" src="http://www.startupjobs.asia/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/successfulmatch.jpg" width="377" height="257" />
<div>

StartUpJobsAsia is a great platform where young entrepreneurs can meet their dream co-founders. Another golden opportunity offerd by this website is networking events where people can meet each other in person. Although today more young people are considering working in a start-ups, every entrepreneur who is looking for right talents knows that it is especially difficult in Singapore to find technical co-founder.

StartUpJobsASia helped me to solve this problem – I met my match on the first event that I visited. I strongly suggest everyone who is looking for a perfect team submit their vacancies on StartUpJobsAsia and also find time to visit their networking events.

Thank you guys for this great initiative!

<div>Hi guys – just wanted to thank Ben and the crew behind Startup Jobs Asia. It addresses a real pain point that the Startup market is facing today (my bet is that the situation will grow even more critical going forward). I already have some very promising candidates lined up for interviews (will give you a update posting later if all goes well). Lets get the word out that Startup Jobs rock! And Startup Jobs Asia is the place to find them!<br />
